 * ANAKIN: Padme, I saw your ship . . .
They embrace.
PADME: Oh, Anakin!
ANAKIN: It's all right, you're safe now. What are you doing out here?
PADME: I was so worried about you. Obi-Wan told me terrible things.
ANAKIN: What things?
PADME: He said you have turned to the dark side . . . that you killed younglings.
ANAKIN: Obi-Wan is trying to turn you against me.
PADME: He cares about us.
ANAKIN: Us??!
PADME: He knows . . . He wants to help you.
ANAKIN: Is Obi-Wan going to protect you? He can't ... he can't help you. He's not strong
enough.
PADME: Anakin, all I want is your love.
ANAKIN: Love won't save you, Padme. Only my new powers can do that.
PADME: At what cost? You are a good person. Don't do this.
ANAKIN: I won't lose you the way I lost my mother! I've become more powerful than any Jedi
has ever dreamed of and I've done it for you. To protect you.
PADME: Come away with me. Help me raise our child. Leave everything else behind while
we still can.
ANAKIN: Don't you see, we don't have to run away anymore. I have brought peace to the
Republic. I am more powerful than the Chancellor. I can overthrow him, and together you
and I can rule the galaxy. Make things the way we want them to be.
PADME: I don't believe what I'm hearing . . . Obi-Wan was right. You've changed.
ANAKIN: I don't want to hear any more about Obi-Wan. The Jedi turned against me. Don't
you turn against me.
PADME: I don't know you anymore. Anakin, you're breaking my heart. I'll never stop loving
you, but you are going down a path I can't follow.
ANAKIN: Because of Obi-Wan?
PADME: Because of what you've done . . . what you plan to do. Stop, stop now. Come back!
I love you.
ANAKIN: (seeing Obi-Wan) Liar!
PADME turns around and. sees OBI-WAN standing in the doorway of the Naboo Cruiser.
PADME: No!
ANAKIN: You're with him. You brought him here to kill me!
PADME: NO! Anakin. I swear ... I ...
ANAKIN reaches out, and force chokes PADME.
OBI-WAN: Let her go, Anakin.
OBI-WAN: Let her go!
ANAKIN releases his grip on the unconscious PADME and she crumples to the ground.
ANAKIN: You turned her against me.
OBI-WAN: You have done that yourself.
ANAKIN: You will not take her from me.
ANAKIN throws off his cloak.
OBI-WAN: Your anger and your lust for power have already done that.
OBI-WAN flings off his cloak.
OBI-WAN: (continuing) You have allowed this Dark Lord to twist your mind until now . . . until
now you have become the very thing you swore to destroy.
They circle each other until OBI-WAN is near PADME. He places his hand on her.
ANAKIN: Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan. I see through the lies of the Jedi. I do not fear the dark
side as you do. I have brought peace, justice, freedom, and security to my new Empire.
OBI-WAN: Your new Empire?
ANAKIN: Don't make me kill you.
OBI-WAN: Anakin, my allegiance is to the Republic ... to democracy.
ANAKIN: If you're not with me, then you're my enemy.
OBI-WAN: Only a Sith deals in absolutes. I will do what I must.
(ignites his lightsaber)
ANAKIN: You will try.
